# BrailleTranslator
This project is submitted in my final year. All the details of the project along with the code is attached here. I took (this project's)[https://github.com/Machine-Learning-Tokyo/tactile_patterns "Source Code"] code and improved by added functionalities into it. We aim to bring one solution for all problem.

# Abstract
This project aims to assist non-blind teachers in providing effective learning support for their visually impaired students. It involves the development of software that enables the conversion of various inputs, such as English text and special characters, images, and voice recordings, into braille output. The braille output can be printed as a soft copy, while also being produced in a physical form using an Arduino Uno and solenoid actuator setup. The software component of the project allows teachers to easily create and share braille-based instructional materials, including lesson plans, assignments, and notes, with their blind students. This eliminates the need for teachers to outsource the creation of braille materials on pre-existing ones that may not be tailored to their specific curricula. The hardware component of the project, utilizing the Arduino Uno and solenoid actuator, allows for the quick and easy printing of braille output. This makes it possible for visually impaired students to have access to braille-based learning materials in a timely and convenient manner.
